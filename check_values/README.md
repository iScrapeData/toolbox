# Description
This program checks for a value in a dataframe. The "check" value can be set manually as string. Or, another dataframe can be used as the check.

This small snippet of code can be used as loop-logic to determine if a Scraper should be entered; or if that iteration should be passed.

# Step 1
Choose and build your logic with check.values.py

# Step 2
Check your logic in a training program - tester.py

# Step 3
